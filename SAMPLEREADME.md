## A polished Github profile is an important part of our public identity as a developer. Why? For one thing, it will most likely be the first place that potential employers look to evaluate your skills and professionalism. And it also allows you to connect with and showcase your work to other developers, which can lead to interesting collaborations. A key component of your profile, and one that many new developers overlook, is the README file that’s associated with each repository. A README file acts like a virtual storefront to a repository-it’s the first thing that a person sees when they visit a rep on Github. But it’s also much more than that: README files contain essential information about the repo’s project. Thus, the quality of a README file can differentiate a high-quality repo from a low-quality one.
